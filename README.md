# Natural Language Processing for Disaster Tweet Classification

## Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not. This classification task can be valuable for various applications, including disaster response and public safety.

## Goal:
The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can automatically classify tweets based on their content, enabling timely and effective response efforts during disasters. The model should achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between disaster-related and non-disaster-related tweets.

## Data:
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled tweets, where each tweet is annotated as either related to a disaster (positive class) or not (negative class). The dataset includes text content of tweets along with corresponding labels.

## Methodology:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the distribution of the data, identifying patterns, and exploring relationships between variables.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the text data, including tasks such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming.
    Modeling: Building and training machine learning models for tweet classification. This includes steps like embedding the text data, defining the model architecture, and training the model on the training data.
    Testing: Evaluating the performance of the trained model on unseen test data to assess its predictive accuracy and generalization ability.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): During EDA, we analyze the distribution of target classes, explore the distribution of tweet lengths, examine the most common keywords, and visualize other relevant patterns in the data. EDA helps in gaining insights into the characteristics of the dataset and informs subsequent modeling decisions.
2. Data Processing: Data processing involves cleaning and preprocessing the text data to make it suitable for modeling. This includes tasks such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, tokenization, removing stopwords, and stemming.
3. Modeling: Modeling involves building and training machine learning models for tweet classification. We experiment with different architectures, such as LSTM-based neural networks, to capture the sequential nature of text data effectively.
4. Testing: Testing involves evaluating the performance of the trained model on unseen test data. We assess metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the model's effectiveness in classifying tweets.

## Key Techniques
1. Porter Stemmer:
    The Porter Stemmer is a popular algorithm for stemming, which is the process of reducing words to their root or base form. It removes common word endings and suffixes to produce the stem of a word, thus reducing multiple variations of the same word to a single root form. In the project, the Porter Stemmer was used to preprocess the text data by reducing words to their stems, thereby simplifying the vocabulary and improving model performance.

2. WordCloud:
    A WordCloud is a visual representation of text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance. It provides a quick and intuitive way to visualize the most common words in a corpus of text. In the project, WordClouds were generated to visualize the most frequent words in disaster-related and non-disaster-related tweets, helping to identify key themes and patterns in the data.

3. One-Hot Representation:
    One-Hot Encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into a numerical format that can be used for machine learning algorithms. In the context of natural language processing, One-Hot Representation is commonly used to convert words or tokens into numerical vectors. Each word is represented as a vector with all zeros except for a single one at the index corresponding to the word's position in the vocabulary. In the project, One-Hot Representation was used to convert the text data into a format suitable for training machine learning models.

These techniques play crucial roles in various stages of the project, from preprocessing the text data to building and training machine learning models for tweet classification. They enable effective analysis and modeling of textual data, ultimately contributing to the successful development of the predictive model.
